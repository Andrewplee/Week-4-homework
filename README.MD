## Week 4 Homework

# Description

The main purpose of this project is to build a multiple choice quiz by utilizing concenpts like setting a timer, accessing local storage, event listeners, and a dymamically written JS to build HTML.

To utilize the concepts above, I will be setting a timer for the quiz, which the timer will decrease in time when the wrong answer choice is chosen and display the submission page once the timer reaches 0. The timer will remain visible throughout the quiz and disappear once the submission page pops up.

To design the quiz, I will build a question bank that the questions and answers will be shown in addition to an actual answer. To effectively display one question at a time, I will write the code so that one question and the respective answers will be shown. In order to check if the answer is correct, I will be comparing the answer choice to the actual answer.

After finishing the quiz, the users should be able enter his or her name and their score will be displayed on the highscore page.

Overall, this project will allow the users to take a quiz with a timer and log their name on the highscore list.

# Installation

To begin with the quiz page, I planned to have a starting page, quiz page, submission page, and a highscore page, which all of these pages will be within a container. Within the start page, there will be a header

<!-- need to write html explanation here -->

On the starting page, I knew a highscore button will be needed to check the highscore. A start button is also required to start the quiz. The start button also serves as a signal to start the timer countdown. Upon pressing the start button, the container will be transitioning from the start page to the quiz page, which a question and four answer choices will be shown.

In the question page, I knew that upon by choosing the incorrect answer, the timer will decrease and the question page will display the next question. However, if the users choose the correct answer, the timer wil not decrease and move on to the next question. In addtion, the user will also get 5 points towards his or her score, which will not be displayed until the submission page. As the user answers the last question,
